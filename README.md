# hyperskill-Dominoes-python
Have you ever wanted to code a game where the computer is your enemy? Well, this little project allows you to do just that. Take turns playing classic dominoes against your computer in a race to victory. Learn, how artificial intelligence can make use of simple statistics to make educated decisions.

## Syntax
```
dominoes.py
```

## Stages
**Stage #1: Setting Up the Game**  
Create and distribute the domino pieces between the players and the stock. Decide which player will make the first move.  

**Stage #2: The Interface**  
A good game should have a decent interface. Create a user-friendly output section.  

**Stage #3: Taking Turns**  
Bring the game to life. Allow players to take turns until the "end game" condition is met.  

**Stage #4: Enforcing Rules**  
A game should have rules. It's time to introduce them.    

**Stage #5: The AI**  
Random choices are hardly a sign of intelligence. Teach your computer to make educated decisions with the help of basic statistics.
